        <h3>Styling, selectors and declarations</h3>
        <p>Where HTML is used for structuring, CSS is used for styling. A CSS 'rule set' consists of a selector and a
          declaration with different properties and property values:
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>External, internal & inline</h3>
          <p>
            There are three different ways of styling your page. If you'd like to use an external stylesheet you link to
            it in the html file like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-block"><code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;External Stylesheets&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../stylesheets/index.css"&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;

              &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;!-- Here is the rest of your code --&gt;
              &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <p>Your code is in your css file, looks just like the first example above.</p>

          <p>
            An internal stylesheet is completely placed within the head section of your html file. It will look something
            like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-block"><code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;External Stylesheets&lt;/title&gt;
                  &lt;style&gt;
                    p {
                      color: white;
                      width: 80%;
                    }

                    .header {
                      background-color: black;
                    }
                  &lt;/style&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;body&gt;
                  &lt;!-- Here is the rest of your code --&gt;
              &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            You can imagine this might become quite long as your file is doing multiple things at once
            (both styling and structuring) your app might be quite chaotic!
          </p>

          <p>Inline styling will look like this:</p>
          <pre class="code-block"><code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;!-- code with all your metadata --&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;p style="color: blue; font-size: 46px;"&gt;
                  &lt;!-- Code for the content of your paragraph--&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What should I use?</h3>
          <p>
            To add CSS styles to your website, you can use three different ways to insert the CSS.
            You can use an "External Stylesheet", "Internal Stylesheet", or "Inline Style".
            The benefit for using each depends on what you are doing with the Style.The following
            table explains the difference between them.
          </p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr class="table-header">
                <th>external stylesheet</th>
                <th>internal stylesheet</th>
                <th>inline styles</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  The External Stylesheet is a .css file that you link your website to.
                  This makes it so that whatever you change in the .css sheet, will affect
                  every page in your website that it is linked to. This prevents you from
                  having to make many code changes in each page. This is for "global" site changes.
                  As you would like your files to do only one thing at the time (for exmaple structuring,
                  but not styling!) this is the most favorable option.
                </td>
                <td>
                  This makes it easy to apply styles like classes or id's in order to reuse the code.
                  The downside of using an internal stylesheet is that changes to the internal stylesheet
                  only affect the page the code is inserted into, so your code wouldn't be very DRY, and
                  it isn't clear where styling is happening.
                </td>
                <td>
                  The Inline style is specific to the tag itself. The inline style uses the HTML "style"
                  attribute to style a specific tag. This is not recommended, as every CSS change has to
                  be made in every tag that has the inline style applied to it. The Inline style is good
                  for one an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly through the site.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Cascading</h3>
          <p>
            At some point in your work, you'll find yourself in the situation where multiple CSS rules will
            have selectors matching the same element. In such cases, which CSS rule "wins", and ends up being
            the one that is finally applied to the element? This is controlled by a mechanism called the Cascade;
            this is also related to inheritance (elements will take some property values from their parents, but not others.)
            At its most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that.
            Which selectors win in the cascade depends on three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Importance</li>
            <li>Specificity</li>
            <li>Source order</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The declaration !important always wins over all others. Let's look at an example from
            <a class= "inline" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance">
              MDN
            </a>
          </p>

          <pre class="code-block"><code>
            &lt;p class="better"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class="better" id="winning"&gt;One selector to rule them all!&lt;/p&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <pre class="code-block"><code>
            #winning {
              background-color: red;
              border: 1px solid black;
            }

            .better {
              background-color: gray;
              border: none !important;
            }

            p {
              background-color: blue;
              color: white;
              padding: 5px;
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            The color and padding values of the rules in the element-selector will be applied (white and 5px), but not the background-color.
            Why? Really all three should surely apply, because rules later in the source order generally override earlier
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the rules above it win. Because 'id' and 'class' selectors have higher specificity than element selectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both elements have a class of 'better', but the first one has an id called #winning and id's have an even higher
            specificity than classes. You can only have one element with a unique id on a page, but many elements with
            the same class — ID selectors are very specific in what they target. The red background color and the 1 pixel
            black border should both be applied to the 2nd element, with the first element getting the gray background
            color, and no border, as specified by the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2nd element does get the red background color, but no border. Why? Because of the !important declaration
            in the second rule — including this after border: none means that this declaration will win over the border
            value in the previous rule, even though the ID has higher specificity.
          </p>
