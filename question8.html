  <h1> CSS: FlexBox</h1>
  <h3>

       <p>
         The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout
         model and method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and with powerful
         alignment capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>You need to think in containers and items:</p>
       <img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flex-container.svg" alt="container" />
       <img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flex-items.svg" alt="items" />
       <p>
         The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width, height
         and order to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen
         sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
